<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
   This document describes the GS1 Digital License Ecosystem. GS1 and its country-based Member Organizations
   (<abbr title="Member Organization">MO</abbr> plural <abbr title="GS1 Member Organizations">MOs</abbr>) form a federated system that issues unique identifiers to its
   Member Companies (<abbr title="GS1 Member Company">MC</abbr> plural <abbr title="GS1 Member Companies">MCs</abbr>) for trade items and entities including -- but not
   limited to -- <abbr title="Global Location Numbers">GLNs</abbr> (singular <abbr title="Global Location Numbers">GLN</abbr>), <abbr title="Global Trade Identification Numbers">GTINs</abbr> (singular <abbr title="Global Trade Identification Number">GTIN</abbr>),
   <abbr title="Global Returnable Asset Identifiers">GRAIs</abbr>

   <abbr title="Serialized Shipping Container Codes">SSCCs</abbr> (singular <abbr title="Serialized Shipping Container Code">SSCC</abbr>) ,
    and other GS1 ID Keys.  As trade communications becomes increasingly digital,
   GS1 is extending it's license system to provide digital licenses using <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr>
   Verifiable Credentials (<abbr title="Verifiable Credentials">VCs</abbr> singular <abbr title="Verifiable Credential">VC</abbr>).  These
   GS1 License Credentials allow companies to prove their authority over their GS1 ID Keys and product data.
   This document is intended for MO and MC <abbr title="Information Technology">IT</abbr> architects and developers
   who wish to understand and use GS1 License Credentials to issue trusted GS1 ID keys and verifiable product data.
