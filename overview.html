        <h3>About GS1</h3>

        <p>GS1 is a neutral, global collaboration platform that brings industry leaders, government, regulators, academia, and associations together to develop standards-based solutions to address the challenges of data exchange. Our scale and reach—local Member Organisations (MOs) in 118 countries, over two million member companies (MCs) and 10 billion transactions every day—helps ensure that there is a common language of business across the globe.</p>

        <p>The sound of a beep at the checkout counter. The GS1 barcode launched a digital revolution that forever changed the way the world does business. With a simple scan a product could be identified and connected to a computerised system. Companies of all sizes need barcode numbers to correctly identify and sell their products in stores or online. The power of the data captured through the barcode is helping to solve large and complex industry challenges.</p>

        <p> Consumers, patients, business partners and regulators are demanding more and better product data than ever before—but complex and costly data exchange processes are producing a surge in low-quality data. GS1 empowers industry’s digital transformation by enabling businesses to create a digital version of a product that is as good as the physical one. Ultimately, consumers and patients will benefit from increased product transparency and the seamless experiences that this brings.</p>

        <p>GS1 standards are the most widely used system of standards in the world. By enabling the sharing of trusted quality data everywhere, they tell the story behind products—where they originated, what they contain and where they have been during their supply-chain journey. This, in turn, removes friction between business partners and improves performance and safety across the entire supply chain.</p>

        <h3>GS1 Idenitfication Keys (GS1 <abbr title="Identification">ID</abbr> Keys)</h3>

        <p>GS1 ID Keys give companies efficient ways to access information about items in their supply chains, and share this information with trading partners. GS1 ID Keys enable organisations to assign standard identifiers to products, documents, physical locations and more. Because GS1 ID Keys are globally unique, they can be shared between organisations, increasing supply chain visibility for trading partners. To build a GS1 ID Key, your organisation must become a member of GS1 and obtain a GS1 Company Prefix (<abbr title="GS1 Company Prefix">GCP</abbr>). This will form the basis of your GS1 ID Keys. There are twelve Tier 1 GS1 ID Keys, allowing organisations to connect physical events and related information, as in the table below.</p>

    <p>The GS1 System supports various Keys not directly administered by GS1.  These are referred to as Tier 2 - 4 Keys.  They are addressed in <a href="#tricky-topics"></a>.

    <section id="GS1-Licenses">
        <h2>GS1 Licenses</h2>
        <p>MCs need to obtain and maintain a license to create GS1 ID Keys. Companies can license GCPs
            or individual GS1 ID Keys from any GS1 MO regardless of their physical location. License types and terms vary. See Section <a href='#licensing'></a> for details. For more on licensing from GS1, see <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.gs1.org/standards/id-keys/company-prefix">https://www.gs1.org/standards/id-keys/company-prefix"</a>.
        </p>

        <p> Three license types are relevant to the current Digital License System:
            <ul class="orange-bullets">
              <li>GS1 Prefix Licenses</li>
              <li>GS1 Company Prefix Licenses (<abbr title="GS1 Company Prefixes">GCPs</abbr> singular <abbr title="GS1 Company Prefix">GCP</abbr>)</li>
              <li>GS1 Single Issue Key Licenses</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <section id="GS1-prefix-Licenses">
            <h2>GS1 Prefix Licenses</h2>
            <p>GS1 Prefix Licenses are issued by the GS1 Global Office (<abbr title="GS1 Global Office">GO</abbr>) to GS1 MOs throughout the world.  These prefix licenses are short numbers that authorize the MO to issue GS1 Company Prefixes and GS1 ID Keys to its members.  For example the prefixes 500 - 509 are licensed to GS1 UK.
        </section>

        <section id="GS1-company-prefix-Licenses">
            <h2>GS1 Company Prefix Licenses</h2>
            <p>GCPs are typically issued by an MO to a Member Company.  MOs are only allowed to issue GCPs that begin with one of the GS1 Prefix License issued to them by GS1 GO. For example, the GCP 5000358 was issued to Tesco Stores Limited by GS1 UK; a GCP starts with the GS1 Prefix 500 which is
            licensed to GS1 UK by GS1 GO. </p>
            <p>A company with a valid GCP can issue any GS1 ID Key that begins with this prefix according to the GS1 assignment guidelines (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.gs1.org/sites/default/files/docs/idkeys/gs1_id_keys_reference_card.pdf.pdf">quick reference card</a>).</p>
        </section>

        <section id="GS1-single-issue-Licenses">
            <h2>GS1 Single Issue Licenses</h2>
            <p>Some MOs issue licenses for individual GS1 ID Keys, typically GTIN or GLN.  This is common practice for small companies needing only a few GTINs or companies that need a GLN but are not creating their own products or shipments. In addition, for size-constrained producs MCs can license individual GTINs called GTIN-8 which have a more compact barcode representation.</p>

    <section id="GS1-Digital-Links">
        <h3>GS1 Digital Links</h3>
        <p>GS1 Digital Link is the standard method for encoding GS1 ID Keys and select product attributes into <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"  href="https://ref.gs1.org/ai/">GS1 Application Identifiers</a> (<abbr title="GS1 Application Identifier">AI</abbr>) formatted as a (<abbr title="Universal Resource Identifier">URI</abbr>). These GS1 Identifiers can then be:

            <ul class="orange-bullets">
              <li>Encoded in a QR code or DataMatrix and scanned.</li>
              <li>Connected to online information.</li>
              <li>Used in data standards where URIs are required.</li>
            </ul>

            The standard can be used in different ways depending on the business requirements arising from different use cases.
        </p>

        <p>For example, in healthcare, GS1 identifiers are usually encoded in a GS1 DataMatrix and converted into a GS1 Digital Link <abbr title="Universal resource Identifier">URI</abbr> within the scanning software, usually a mobile phone app. In other cases the app connects to a resolver which returns the link types associated with the specific GTIN. The Digital Link URI is not encoded in a <abbr title="Two Dimensional">2D</abbr> barcode in healthcare applications.</p>

        <p>In retail, GS1 Digital Link is an important part of industry’s global migration to 2D barcodes where the vision is that each product will have a single multipurpose 2D barcode that can be used at the retail point-of-sale, and to access digital content such as certifications, instructions for use, product information, traceability information and more.</p>

        <p>Use of the GS1 Digital Link standard means that identifiers such as the GTIN are now a gateway to information that strengthens brand loyalty, improves supply chain traceability information, and enables business partner APIs, patient safety information and more.</p>

        <p>Using the GS1 standard means you’re not only providing a <abbr title="Universal resource Locator">URL</abbr> for people to scan, you’re also providing GS1 identifiers – the same identifiers relied upon throughout industry today – and leveraging open global standards. The brand owner can link from the GS1 Digital Link URI to any number of digital information sources, all from one barcode symbol, saving space and improving efficiency. Digital content can be continually updated by a brand owner, without the need to change the QR Code with GS1 Digital Link URI on-pack, meaning packaging or artwork does not need to be changed for access to things like new promotions or usage ideas. Meanwhile, retailers, supply chain partners, and third-party applications, like diet and health apps, can still make use of the barcode as an entry point to look up their own information in their IT systems, exactly as they do today.</p>

        <p>GS1 Digital Link can represent all GS1 ID Keys and many relevant <abbr title="Application Identifiers">AIs</abbr> including GTIN, Batch/Lot, Expiration Date, Serial Number etc., allowing a single URI format to represent
